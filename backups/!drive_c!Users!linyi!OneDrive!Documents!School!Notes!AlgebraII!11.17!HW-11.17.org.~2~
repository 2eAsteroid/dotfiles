* Problem 8 (pg. 347)
\begin{problem}
Matrices $A$ and $B$ are conformable for multiplication in the order $AB$ if the product $AB$ is defined. Suppose $A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 & 5 \\ 2 & 4 & 6 \end{pmatrix}$
\end{problem}
** Part A
\begin{problem}
What size matrices $B$ are conformable for multiplication with $A$ in the order $AB$?
\end{problem}
Any matrix of row 3 are conformable.
** Part B
\begin{problem}
What size matrices $B$ are conformable for multiplication with $A$ in the order $BA$?
\end{problem}
Any matrix of column 2 are conformable.
** Part C
\begin{problem}
What size matrices $B$ are conformable for multiplication with $A$ in either order?
\end{problem}
Only a matrix of size $3 \times 2$.

* Problem 9 (pg. 347)
\begin{problem}
For what size matrix $A$ is it true that whenever $B$ is the same size as $A$, then $AB$ exists?
\end{problem}
The matrix would have to be a square matrix.

* Problem 10 (pg. 347)
\begin{problem}
For what size matrix $A$ is it true that whenever $B$ is the same size as $A$, then $BA$ exists?
\end{problem}
The matrix has to be a square matrix.

* Problem 11 (pg. 347)
\begin{problem}
Consider the equations below.
\begin{align*}
z_{1} = y_{1} + 2y_{2} \\
z_{2} = 3y_{1} - 4y_{2} \\
y_{1} = 2x_{1} - x_{2} \\
y_{2} = 3x_{1} + x_{2} \\
\end{align*}
Use matrix multiplication (not direct substitution to find formulas for $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ in terms of $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$).
\end{problem}
When you convert the first two equations to a matrix, you get,
\begin{gather*}
\begin{pmatrix}
z_{1} \\
z_{2}
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & -4
\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} y_{1} \\ y_{2} \end{pmatrix}\\
\text{However, you can replace the second matrix with another matrix to result in, }\\
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & -4
\end{pmatrix} \cdot
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & -1 \\
3 & 1
\end{pmatrix}\\
\text{Multiplying these together results in, }\\
\begin{pmatrix}
8 & 1 \\
-6 & -7
\end{pmatrix}\\
\text{When you convert that back into equations, you obtain, }\\
z_{1} = 8x_{1} + x_{2} \\
z_{2} = -6x_{1} - 7x_{2}
\end{gather*}

* Problem 13 (pg. 347)
\begin{problem}
For fundraisers, Local High School has a car wash and a play. All students are encouraged to sell tickets at $5 for a car wash and $10 for the play. The bordered matrix below shows how many tickets each class has sold.
\end{problem}
** Part A
\begin{problem}
Copy and complete the following matrix. Use a matrix product to compute the entries.
\end{problem}
\begin{gather*}
\begin{pmatrix}
300 & 250 & 135 \\
2000 & 1750 & 1100
\end{pmatrix}
\end{gather*}
** Part B
\begin{problem}
Use another matrix product to determine the total revenue and total ticket sales for all three classes together.
\end{problem}
