* Youtube-dl / Spotdl CLI
Opening up a new world of access to music / videos, youtube-dl is a great tool. However, I feel like some people would be disinclined to use this piece of software, because of its CLI tool properties. Also, it mostly supports youtube only, as suggested by its name. I want to combine youtube-dl and spotdl, a Spotify downloader, into a beautiful CLI app, like that "TODO list app using Go" video.

* Todo List App in Rust
I found a tutorial on how to do this, so I want to give it a whirl and see if I could make my own.

* Maths Library, maybe for the new language Niranjan made?
It's quite evident on what this is. I'll add some stuff from Niranjan's language later, and some ideas.
