#+TITLE: Malware Propagation

* Malware Info
Malware is still the biggest threat to digital assets/devices. They want your devices because they realized that they (black hats) can get monetary value from using your devices. By using *your* devices, they can:
 - Make it harder to link the crime to them
 - prevent isolation of the device
 - Be able to use the computing power of many machines

In the past, malware was used for silly purposes, but now it's all about the money.
