#+author: Daniel L.

* TL;DR
 - Set your *goals* and the argument's *tense*
 - Think of whether you want to emphasize *character* (ethos), *logic* (logos), or *emotion* (pathos)
 - Make sure the *time* (kairos) and the *medium* (in-person, email, text, page, newspaper, et cetera) are ripe for persuasion


* When Drafting a Speech or Presentation
Use Cicero's outline:
 - Introduction (Introduce your speech; this is a good place to start ethos)
 - Narration (Tell a vivid story)
 - Division (Represent your enemy's side)
 - Proof (Back up your side with logos and figures)
 - Refutation (Take a likely point of your opponent and break it down)
 - Conclusion (Take your strongest points and redeliver them; use figures; crescendo of pathos)


* Goals

** *Personal Goal:*
What you want from your audience.

** /Audience Goals:/
 - *Mood:* The easiest thing to change.
 - *Mind:* A step up in difficulty from changing the mood
 - *Willingness to Act:* Hardest of all, because it requires an emotional commitment and identification with the action.


** *Issue Control:*
Mastering argument's chief topics.
 - *Blame:* Covers the past. Aristotle called this kind of argument /forensic/. Its chief topics are /guilt/ and /innocence/.
 - *Values:* Get argued in the present tense. This is /demonstrative/ or tribal rhetoric. Chief topics: /praise/ and /blame/.
 - *Choice:* Deals with the future. This is deliberative argument, the
   rhetoric of politics. Its chief topic is the /advantageous/ -- what's best for the audience.


* Ethos
This is argument by character -- using your reputation or someone
else's as the basis for argument. When you give a speech, play up your
character -- or what you want the audience to think it is. Its three
chief aspects are /virtue/, /practical wisdom/, and /disinterest/.

** Decorum
Your ability to fit in with the audience's expectations of a
trustworthy leader.

 - *Code Grooming:* Using language unique to the audience.
 - *Identity Strategy:* Getting an audience to identify with an
   action -- to see the choice as one that helps define them as a group.
 - *Irony:* Saying one thing to outsiders with a meaning revealed only
   to your group.

** Virtue, or Cause:
The appearance of living up to your audience's values.

 - *Bragging:* The straightforward, and least effective, way to
   enhance your virtue.
 - *Witness Bragging:* An endorsement by a third party, the more
   disinterested the better.
 - *Tactical Flaw:* A defect or mistake, intentionally revealed, that
   shows your rhetorical virtue.
 - *Switching Sides:* Appearing to have supported the powers that be
   all along.
 - *Eddie Haskell Ploy:* Throwing your support behind the inevitable
   to show off your virtue (you won't find the Eddie Haskell ploy as
   such in rhetorical texts, but the concept appears frequently).
 - *Logic-free Values:* Focusing on individual value-words and
   commonplaces to bring a group together and get it to identify with you.
 - *Identity:* Get people to describe themselves. Usually the first
   thing they mention reveals their best sense of who they are. And
   most people will do just about anything to live up to that
   identity.

** Practical Wisdom, or Craft:
/Phronesis/ is the name Aristotle gave this rhetorical street savvy.
 - Showing off experience
 - Bending the rules
 - Appearing to take the middle course

** Disinterest, or Caring:
Aristotle called this /eunoia/ -- an apparent willingness to sacrifice
your own interests for the greater good.
 - *Reluctant Conclusion:* Appearing to have reached your conclusion
   only because of its overwhelming rightness.
 - *Personal Sacrifice:* Claiming that the choice will help your
   audience more than it it'll help you.
 - *Dubitatio:* Seeming doubtful of your own rhetorical skill.

** Liar Detector:
Techniques for judging a person's credibility.
 - *Needs Test:* Do the persuader's needs match your needs?
 - *Comparable Experience:* Has the persuader actually done what
   they're talking about?
 - *Dodged Question:* Ask who benefits from the choice. If you don't
   get a straight answer, don't trust that person's disinterest.
 - *"That Depends" Filter:* Instead of a one-size-fits-all choice, the
   persuader offers a solution tailored to you.
 - *"Sussing" Ability:* The persuader cuts to the chase of an issue.
 - *Extremes:* How does the persuader describe the opposing argument?
   How close is their middle of the road to yours?
   - *Extremist Detector:* An extremist will describe a moderate
     choice as extreme.
 - *Virtue Yardstick:* Does the persuader find the sweet spot between
   the extremes of your values?
 - *Code Inoculation:* Be aware of the terms that define the groups
   you belong to, and watch out when a persuader uses them.

** Screw-up Recovery
Enhancing your ethos through your own mistakes.
 - Set your goals right after you screw up.
 - Be first with the news.
 - Switch immediately to the future.
 - Avoid belittling the victim.
 - Don't apologize. Instead, express your feelings about not living up
   to your own standards.


* Pathos
Argument by emotion is the seductive part of persuasion. /Pathos/ can
cause a mood change, make an audience more receptive to your logic,
and give them an emotional commitment to your goal.

** Sympathy:
Registering concern for your audience's emotions.
 - *Oversympathizing:* Exagerrated sympathy can make your audience
   feel ashamed of an emotion you want ot change.

** Belief:
Aristotle said this is the key to emotion.
 - *Experience:* Refer to the audience's own experience, or plant one
   in their heads; this is the past tense of belief.
 - *Storytelling:* A way to give the audience a virtual experienec.
 - *Expectation:* Make an audience expect something good or bad, and
   the apporpriate emotion will follow.

** Volume Control:
Underplaying an emotion, or gradually increasing it so that the
audience can feel it along with you.
 - *Simple Speech:* Don't use fancy language when you get emotional.

** Unannounced Emotion:
Avoid tipping off your audience in advance of a mood. They'll resist
it.

** Passive Voice:
If you want to redirect an audience's anger away from someone, imply
that the action happened on its own: "The chair got broken", not
"Pablo broke the chair".

** Backfire:
You can calm an individual's emotion in advance by overplaying it
yourself. This works especially well when you screw up and want to
prevent the wrath of an authority.

** Persuasive Emotions:
 - *Anger:* One of the most effective ways to rouse an audience to
   actin. But it's a short-lived emotion.
 - *Belittlement Charge:* Show your opponent dissing your audience's
   desires. A belittled audience is an angry one, according to Aristotle.
 - *Patriotism:* Attaches a choice or action to the audience's sense
   of group identity.
 - *Emulation:* Emotional response ot a role model. The greater your
   /ethos/, the more the audience will imitate you.
 - *Humor:* A good calming device that can enhance your /ethos/.
   - *Urban Humor:* Plays off a word or part of speech.
   - *Wit:* Situational humor.
   - *Facetious Humor:* Joke telling, a relatively ineffective form of persuasion.
   - *Banter:* Snappy answers -- works best in defense.

** Figures of Speech
You'll find the individual figures in the glossary. But here are the
essential ways that you can create your own figures.
 - *Cliché Twisting:* Using overworked language to your advantage.
   - *Literal Interpretation:* Reducing a cliché to absurdity by
     seeming to take it at face value.
   - *Surprise Ending:* Starting a cliché as it's normally said, but
     ending it differently.
   - *Reworking:* Switching words around in a cliché.
 - *Word Swap:* Changing normal usage and grammar for effect.
   - *Chiasmus:* Creates a crisscross sentence.
 - *Weighing Both Sides:* Comparing or contrasting opinions in order
   to define the issue.
   - *Either/Or Figure (Dialysis):* Weighs each side equally.
   - *Contrasting Figure (Antithesis):* Favors one side over another.
   - *Meaning-Change Figure (antistasis):* Repeats a word in a way
     that uses or defines it differently.
 - *Editing Out Loud:* Interrupting yourself or your opponent to
   correct something.
   - *Self-Correction Figure (Metanoia):* Lets you amplify an argument
     while seeming to be fair and accurate.
   - *Redefiner (Correctio):* Repeats the opponent's language and
     corrects it.
 - *Volume Control:* Amplifying or calming speech through figures.
   - *Litotes:* Ironic understatement. Makes you seem cooler than your opponent.
   - *Climax:* Uses overlapping words in successive phrases in a
     rhetorical crescendo.
 - *Word Invention:* Figures help you create new words or meanings
   from old words; they make you look clever.
   - *Verbing (Anthimeria):* Turns a noun into a verb or vice versa.
   - *"Like" Figure (Parelcon):* Strips a word of meaning and uses it
     as a pause or for emphasis.


* Logos
Argument by logic. People like to think that all argument should be
nothing /but/ logic; however, Aristotle said that when it comes to
persuasion, rational speech needs emotion and character as well.

** Deduction:
Applying a general principle to a particular matter.
 - *Enthymeme:* A logic sandwich that contains deduction "We should
   [choice], because [commonplace]." Aristotle took formal logic's
   syllogism, stripped it down, and based it on a commonplace instead
   of a universal truth.
 - *Proof Spotter:* A proof consists of examples or a premise. A
   premise usually begins with "because," or implies it.
 - *Commonplace:* Any cliché, belief, or value that can serve as your
   audience's boiled-down public opinion. It's the starting point of
   your argument.
   - *Babbling:* An audience's repittion of a word or idea; it often
     reveals a commonplace.
   - *Rejection:* Another good commonplace spotter. An audience will
     often use a commonplace when it rejects your argument.
   - *Commonplace Label:* Applying a commonplace to an idea, a
     proposal, or a piece of legislation as part of a definition
     strategy.

** Induction:
Argument by example. It starts with the specific and moves to the
general.
 - *Fact, Comparison, Story:* The three kinds of examples to use in
   inductive logic.

** Concession:
Using your opponent's own argument to your advantage.

** Framing:
Shaping the bounds of an argument. This is a modern persuasive term;
you won't find it in the classic rhetorics.

 - *Framing Strategy:*
   1. Find the audience's commonplaces
   2. Define the issue broadly, appealing to the values of the widest audience.
   3. Deal with the specific problem or choice, using the future
      tense.
 - *Definition Strategy:* Controlling the language used in an argument.
 - *Term Change:* Inserting your own language in place of your opponent's.
 - *Redefinition:* Accepting your opponent's terms while changing
   their ocnnotation.
 - *Definition Jujitsu:* Using your opponent's language to attack him.
 - *Definition Judo:* Using terms that contrast with your opponent's,
   creating a context that makes him look bad.

** Logical Fallacies:
It's important to detect them, just as you should spot any kind of
persuasive tactic used against you. Another reason to understand
fallacious logic: you may want to use it yourself.

 - *Bad Proof:* The argument's commonplace or principle is
   unacceptable, or the examples are bad.
   - *False Comparison:* Two things are similar, so they must be the same.
   - *All Natural Fallacy:* Natural ingredients are good for you, so
     anythng called "natural" is healthful. Also called /fallacy of association/.
   - *Appeal to Popularity:* "Other kids get to do it, so why don't I?"
   - *Hasty Generalization:* Uses too few examples and interprets them
     too broadly.
   - *Misinterpreting the Evidence:* Takes the exception and claims it
     proves the rule.
   - *Unit Fallacy:* Does weird math with apple and oranges, often
     confusing the part for the whole.
   - *Fallacy of Ignorance:* Claims that if something has not been
     proven, it must be false.
 - *Bad Conclusion:* We're given too many choices, or not enough, or
   the conclusion is irrelevant to the argument.
   - *Many Questions:* Squashes two or more issues into a single one.
   - *False Dilemma:* Offers the audience two choices when more
     actually exist.
   - *Fallacy of Antecedent:* Assumes that this moment is identical to
     past, similar moments.
   - *Red Herring:* Introduces an irrelevant issue to distract or
     confuse the audience.
   - *Straw Man:* Sets up a different issue that's easier to argue.
 - *Disconnect Between Proof and Conclusion:* The proof stands up all
   right, but it fails to lead to the conclusion.
   - *Tautology:* A logical redundancy; the proof and the conclusion
     are the same thing.
   - *Reductio Ad Absurdum:* Takes the opponent's choice and reduces
     it to an absurdity.
   - *Slippery Slope:* Predicts a series of dire events stemming from
     one choice.
   - *Post Hos Ergo Propter Hoc:* Assumes that if one thing follows
     another, the first thing caused the second one. I call this the
     /Chanticleer fallacy/.

** Rhetorical Fouls:
Mistakes or intentional offenses that stop an argument dead or make it
fail to reach a consensus.
 - *Sweitching Tenses away from the Future:* It's fine to use the past
   or present, but deliberative argument depends on eventually
   discussing the future.
 - *Inflexible Insistence on the Rules:* Using the voice of God,
   sticking to your guns, refusing to hear the other side.
 - *Humiliation:* An argument that sets out only to debase someone,
   not ot make a choice.
 - *Innuendo:* A form of irony used to debase someone. It often plants
   an idea in the audience's head by denying it.
 - *Threatening:* Rhetoricians call this /argumentum ad baculum/ --
   argument by the stick. It denies the audience a choice.
 - *Nasty Language or Signs:*
 - *Utter Stupidity:*


* Kairos
The Romans called it /occasio/, the art of seizing the
occasion. /Kairos/ depends on /timing/ and the /medium/.

** Persuasive Moment:
When the audience is ripest for your argument.
 - *Moment Spotter:* Uncertain moods and beliefs -- when minds are
   already beginning to change -- signal a persuasive moment.
 - *Perfect Audience:* Receptive, attentive, and well diposed toward you.
 - *Audience Change:* If the current audience isn't ready for
   persuasion, seek another one. This is what market research is all
   about.

** Senses:
The five senses are key to the proper medium.
 - *Sight:* Mostly /pathos/ and /ethos/.
 - *Sound:* The most logical sense.
 - *Smell ,Taste, and Touch:* Almost purely emotional.



* Speechmaking

** Invention:
The crafting part of a speech. It's tools are the tools of /logos/.

** Arrangement:
The organization of a speech.
 - *Introduction*
 - *Narration*
 - *Proof*
 - *Refutation*
 - *Conclusion*

** Style:
Choice of words that make a speech attractive to the listener. The
five virtues of style:
 - *Proper Language*
 - *Clarity*
 - *Vividness*
 - *Decorum*
 - *Ornament*

** Memory:
The ability to speak without notes.

** Delivery:
The action of giving a speech.
 - *Voice:* Should be loud enough for the room.
 - *Gesture:* The eyes are key, even in a large room, because they
   lead your other facial muscles. Use few hand gestures in a formal speech.
