* Intro
 - Fats can be bad for you if you eat too much, but anything will
 - Cutting fats won't reduce weight if you replace the calories

* Structure
 - Fats :: Molecules used for storing energy
 - Fats have almost twice the amount of energy of carbohydrates and protein
 - Made of long chains of carbon atoms
 - The density of energy and the unhealthiness of eating too much fat resulted in an anti-fat craze
   - They're actually necessary

* Different Types of Fats
** Saturated Fats
Saturated means that they're full of hydrogen atoms (single bond for each).
It's also in a zigzag pattern
 - Artificially made from
   - normal fish, plant oils
   - Made in food manufacturing factories
   - Solid at room temperature
   - Useful for processed foods
   - Cannot be digested
** Unsaturated Fats
They have less hydrogens (maybe a double bond for one hydrogen atom)
 - Natural
 - Fish oils
 - Plant oils
 - Liquids at room temperature
 - Digestible
They're more likely be liquid, because they're not able to be stacked to become polymers
** Single v. Double Bonds
Single bonds can somewhat rotate and can bend, but double bonds lock it into place
 - That double bond can lock the chain into a kink, or into a straight line
 - Shorthand for chains: Zigzags with vertices representing the carbon atoms
** Cis Isomer
 - Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula, but different structure
 - This cis isomer is what determines if a unsaturated fat is trans or cis
** Trans Fats
They have double bonds, as well as stack well
That can create placques, which can block bloodflow and cause heart disease
Extremely dangerous
 - 2% Increase = 23% Increase in Heart Disease
** Cis Fats
Normal unsaturated fats; they don't stack well
** Polyunsaturated Fats
Unsaturated fats with more than one double bond
** Monounsaturated Fats
Unsaturated fats have only one double bond
** Omega-3 Fatty Acids
The double bond is at the end; they have health benefits

* Soap
Soaps are also fats
Soaps are amphiphilic, meaning that they have a polar head and a nonpolar tail.

The nonpolar part bunch together and are protected by the polar molecules against water
 - Anything not water soluble will be stuck inside the soap molecule and be brought away

* Terpenes/Terpenoids
Terpenes are oils made from isoprene units, a carbon arrangement
Tepenoids have also other molecules, like oxygen (as in the case with menthol)
