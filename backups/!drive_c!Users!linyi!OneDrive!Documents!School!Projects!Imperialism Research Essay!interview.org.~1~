* Question 1
How have you seen the impact of the KMT in Taiwan?

The KMT's influence on Taiwan...They would buy votes to.. not everyone's vote can be bought, only those who support them. Another thing is... When you join the KMT, you'll have a higher chance of getting a government job, if you're a member. Also, the candidates' from the KMT might pay money to buy uneducated peoples' votes. Because most people are poor, candidates would give money to the uneducated people to win their vote.
