* Cladogram Rules
 1. Show time as an axis; show which species are extinct and which are still surviving.
 2. Show ancestral and derived characteristics on the char (not at the nodes).

* Definitions
\begin{definition}
Ancestral characteristics: Traits from the ancestor, shared by all the descendants.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Derived characteristics: Mostly evolved traits.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Speciation: When a new species forms when a population becomes distinct or separate from an existing species.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Ingroup: Whatever has the trait you're looking at.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Outgroup: Whatever doesn't have the trait you're looking at.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Monophyletic: Everything in the group shares all common ancestors.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Polyphyletic: A group derived from more than one common ancestor
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Monera: small organisms
\end{definition}

* Organizing the Tree of Life the Old Way: Kingdoms
