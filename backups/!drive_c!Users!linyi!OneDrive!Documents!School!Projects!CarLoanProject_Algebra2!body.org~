* Introduction

The Volkswagen Beetle Type 1 -- one of the most influential cars in the world, only topped by cars like the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citroen DS. It was designed to be the "people's car", a car that was cheap, simple, and could be mass produced for Nazi Germany's new road network. However, although this car was originally formulated by Adolf Hitler, the finalization of the actual car was done by Ferdinand Porsche. This car is sold for the average price of 18,704 USD, with the lowest sale being 985 USD, and the highest being 121,000 USD[fn:1].

The bank I'm planning to get the loan from is the People's Bank[fn:2], which offers a 5.25% APY (Annual Percentage Yield) right now. APY is not interest rate however -- they are similar, but not the same -- so I calculated the interest rate using the APY, which yielded the monthly interest rate of 5.1278%, which is the interest rate I'll be using.

* Problem 1

** Part A

Assuming that you want to pay off the car loan in 36 months (e.g. you want to get into negative debt on the 36th month), here is the chart for the price you can afford, based on an incrementing monthly payment.

| Monthly Payment | Cost of Car |   \Delta |
|-----------------+-------------+-----|
|             450 |       16200 | 360 |
|             460 |       16560 | 360 |
|             470 |       16920 | 360 |
|             480 |       17280 | 360 |
|             490 |       17640 | 360 |
|             500 |       18000 | 360 |
|             510 |       18360 | 360 |
|             520 |       18720 | 360 |
|             530 |       19080 | 360 |
|             540 |       19440 | 360 |
|             550 |       19800 | 360 |
|             560 |       20160 | 360 |
|             570 |       20520 |     |

** Part B
For m \equal the amount of months you want to pay the loan off by[fn:3], and n = the monthly payment you make, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1-B-CF}
b(n) = m \times n
\end{equation}
The recursive form is, for m \equal the amount of months you want to pay the loan off by,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1-B-RF}
b(n) = \begin{cases} 16200, & \mbox{if } n = \mbox{ 450} \\ b(n - 1) + m, & \mbox{if } n \ge \mbox{  450} \end{cases}
\end{equation}

I first constructed the difference table for the table in Part A, and found that the table follows a linear function, as it has a constant first difference. Because we know that the constant first difference is also the slope of the function, we can multiply the monthly payments by the constant first difference to get the maximum cost of the car you can afford. However, since the input is not incrementing by 1, and is instead incrementing by 10, you have to scale the slope by 0.10, since it would take 10 increments of 1 to get an increment of 10.

To find the recursive form of the table, I first thought of the initial condition that the recursive form would start, which would be the first output of the table, 16200, which would be the output if n \equal 450. Because the table follows a linear function, to get the next output using the previous output, you would need to increase it by a constant, which would also be the slope. The slope would then be the same as the slope for the closed-form function, 36.


[fn:3] You want to get to negative debt -- [-\infin, 0] -- by that month. For this problem, it is 36 months.

** Part C

Because n = 360 isn't defined in our recursive form function, we will use the closed form function.

Substituting 360 into \ref{eq:1-B-CF} gives us,
\begin{align}
b(360) &= 36 \times 360 \\
b(360) &= 12960
\end{align}

* Problem 2

Assuming that you want to pay off the loan in 36 months, and the car you want to buy is the aforementioned car, here is the chart that shows the monthly payment for that car, with an incrementing interest rate.

| Interest Rate (%) | Monthly Payment |
|------------------+-----------------|
|                0 |                1 |
|                 1 |                1 |
|                2 |                1 |
|                3 |                1 |
|                4 |                1 |
|                5 |                1 |
|                6 |                1 |
|                7 |                1 |
|                8 |                1 |
|                9 |                1 |
|               10 |                1 |
|                11 |                1 |
|               12 |                1 |
|               13 |                1 |
|               14 |                1 |
|               15 |                1 |
