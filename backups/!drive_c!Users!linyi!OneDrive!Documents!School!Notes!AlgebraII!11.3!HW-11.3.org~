* Problem 6 (pg. 305)
\begin{problem}
Which is the other solution to the system of equations at the right?
\end{problem}
The answer is C.

* Problem 9 (pg. 306)
\begin{problem}
Try using both substitution and elimination to solve the following system. What happens?
\[ x + 2y = 3 \]
\[ 2x + 4y = 4 \]
\end{problem}
It results in a illogical equality, which means that there's no real solution to this system of equations.

* Problem 12 (pg. 306)
\begin{problem}
Solve this system.
\[ x = y + z\]
\[ y = x + z\]
\[ z = x + y\]
\end{problem}
When you rearrange the system, you would get,
\begin{align*}
z &= x - y 
z &= x + y 
z &= y - x
\end{align*}

, which would get you,
\begin{align*}
x - y &= y - x
x + y &= y - x
\end{align*}
, which means that $x$, $y$, and $z$ are all zero.

* Problem 14 (pg. 306)
\begin{problem}
In Exercise 13 from Lesson 4.01, you solve the following system.
\begin{align}
x + 2y + 3z &= 1 \notag\\
3y - z &= 4 \notag\\
2z &= -2 \notag\\
\end{align} \notag\\
The natural way to solve such a triangular system is to solve for $z$ and then substitute. However, you have learned that adding and subtracting equations can accomplish the same thing as substitution. Solve this system again without any substitutions.
\end{problem}
You would subtract equation 2 and 3, leaving you with,
\begin{align}
x + 2y + 3z &= 1 \notag\\
3y - 3z &= 6 \notag\\
\end{align} \notag\\
, and then you can scale and subtract 1 and 2,
\begin{align}
3x + 6y + 9z &= 3 \notag\\
6y - 6z &= 12 \notag\\
3x + 3z &= 15 \notag\\
x + z &= 5 \notag\\
2x + 2z &= 10 \notag\\
2z &= -2 \notag\\
2x &= 12 \notag\\
x &= 6
\end{align} \notag\\
And once we find the other variables, you get,
\begin{align}
x &= 6, \notag\\
y &= 1, \notag\\
z &= -1
\end{align} 
* Problem 15 (pg. 306)
\begin{problem}
Solve this system using addition and subtraction.
\begin{align}
2x - 3y + 5z - 2t &= 9 \notag\\
5y - z + 3t &= 1 \notag\\
7z - t &= 3 \notag\\
2t &= 8 \notag\\
\end{align} \notag\\
\end{problem}

\begin{align}
7z - t &= 3 \label{eqn:one}\\
2t &= 8 \label{eqn:two}\\
\shortintertext{When you subtract \eqref{eqn:two} from \eqref{eqn:one}, you get,}
7z - 3t &= -5 \notag\\
\end{align} \notag\\
