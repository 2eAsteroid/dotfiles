Commodity - Something that's sold in the market
Out of that selling of commodities, money is realized
Money doesn't have any value, it's just represents the exchange values.
Commodities also have use values.
Exchange value is how much the commodity costs.
Use value is how it's useful TO us.
Some things have use values but no exchange values (ex. parks)
Marx talks about the commodity of labor -- it produces use value to both the labourer and the other guy.
The capitalists want to pay the labourer enough to reproduce but also wants to pay the labourer nothing.
That's called surplus value.

Reselling commodities don't give you any more value, you just change the commodity back into its money form.

When buying a commodity in the first cycle, the use value of the commodity doesn't change, but the exchange value changes. This is talking about a particular moment in time.



The use value of a commodity only appears when you actually use the commodity. For capitalists to get more value out of buying commodities, they have to find a commodity where the use value can create more value.

That value is labour.

That labour is the sum of all capabilities that a person has.

In order for capitalists to find this value, a person first has to sell their labour, which they have to have control over.

When they meet in the market, they must be equals, only differentiated by the fact that one is a buyer and one is a seller. After they sell their labor, they are not equals anymore.

To avoid losing their labour-power, they have to sell their labour for a limited amount of time, and treat the labour as their own property.

The second condition for finding this value, is that the person with labour, can't sell a commodity they made, and have to sell their own labour. They have to be enticed to be employed, i.e. they are better off employed than not.

For someone to sell commodities that are not their labour, they have to have means of producing the commodity, and to be sustained while making the commodity (being fed), and if a commodity is produced, they have to sell it, and that can satisfy the producer's needs after they sell it. The time trying to sell it also has to be taken in consideration as well as the time to produce it.

To transform money into assets, they have to find a free worker, in the sense that they are free to sell their own labour, but also free of the means of producing. 

This labourer and this capitalist doesn't come from natural history nor human history; it was produced through many economic revolutions.

To become a commodity, a product has to be produced not for the producer. This only happens in the mode of production of capitalism.

However this can still occur even when most products are for the immediate use of the producer. Until now at least, this production was not controlled by the exchange-value.

This conversion of a product to a commodity needs an organized division of labour in society, so that there's a separation of use-value and exchange-value -- started with barter or just trading.

The existence of money implies that we've already separated use-value and exchange-value to a certain level. The different levels of money indicate different levels of this separation of use-value and exchange-value.

However we know from experience that we need very little of commodity circulation for money to appear, in all of its forms. Capital is different. Capital doesn't arise from only the circulation of money / commodities. It arises when the owner of production / food (capitalists) finds a free worker on the market, who is selling their labour.

Labor has a value, and that value is determined by how much time it takes to produce something.

Use-value is only fully realized when you fully use the commodity/labor.

As long as something has value, it represents only the definite quantity of the labour done for it. Labor-power is a living person's capacity. You have to produce labour to get labour as a commodity. Labour is produced when someone reproduces, or maintains life. That maintanence requires an amount of
