 - KMT forced local Japanese firms to "donate" money to them
   - implementation of racketeering?
 - The KMT was acclaimed for being the richest political party, through their leeching of assets from local companies, firms, people, etc.

   - Post-WW2, and was a revolt in the occupation and conquered territory-phase of Taiwan by the KMT during their war against the Communist party.
 - The occupation of Taiwan by the KMT caused Taiwan to be the land where conflicts on the rightful leadership of China were disputed over.

 - Some of the KMT just looted Taiwan, causing a wealth, and therefore power, imbalance between the KMT and the locals
