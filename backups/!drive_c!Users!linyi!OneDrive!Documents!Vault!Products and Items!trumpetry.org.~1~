#+TITLE: Trumpet Items that I Want to Buy

* Trumpet Mutes
Wah-wah is super funny. I've seen some mutes from the website, Soulo Mutes, which is an option. I want to buy three mutes, and find a fourth:
 - Straight Mute
 - Wah-wah Mute / Harmon Mute
 - Another mute I cannot remember the name of
 - Plunger head

* Trumpet Stand
I want to get a trumpet stand in the future, maybe even one that also holds mutes.

* A Variety of Mouthpieces
I have a 3C and a 7C mouthpiece right now, but I want to experiment and feel out other mouthpieces, like perhaps from Monette?
