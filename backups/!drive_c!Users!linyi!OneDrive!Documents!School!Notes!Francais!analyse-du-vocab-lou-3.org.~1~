#+TITLE: Analyse du Vocab (Lou 3)
#+AUTHOR: Daniel L.
* Notes
 - Lou is translating this notice, which is about a toaster, which is supposed to be in cars?
   - Lou suggests that it might be a traveling toaster
 - Lou's mother has to give this notice to her editor
   - The editor's name is Crodof
   - She wants to write a story, but she doesn't even have a main character yet
     - Lou suggests a heroine that fights bad guys and helps kind people
 - Meanwhile, Lou fights a bully who takes her desserts
   - The bully's been taking her desserts and things since they were little
     - She stole Lou's hotdogs, balls, crayons, and more
   - Lou says that her mother should rebel against the awful Crodof, but she herself is being oppressed by the bully
 - She decides to face the bully, but she does that by not getting a dessert.
   - The bully makes her get one, which she then takes
 - Next, she decides to get the "chef's special", which isn't edible
   - The bully doesn't want it either, but Lou can't eat it
   - She gets a muffin (brioche) later, but the bully takes it
 - Seeing Lou's problem made her mom realize that she should rise up too, and so she goes against her editor
   - She quits that job, and focuses on writing her science fiction novel
 - Seeing her mom rebel made Lou realize that she can too
   - She finally says no, which succeeds
   - However, she doesn't even really like cake
