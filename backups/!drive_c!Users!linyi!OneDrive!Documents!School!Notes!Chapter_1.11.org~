* Ch. 1.1 \to The Study of Life
#+BEGIN_CENTER
Main Idea:

Because Earth is home to a diversity of life, humans have studied living things and life throughout history, which is called biology, or the scientific study of all life.
#+END_CENTER
 
Vocab:
 - biosphere \to Made up of all living things and the places they are found.
 - biodiversity \to The variations of organisms in a given area.
 - species \to Groups of organisms that are closely related and can produce fertile offspring.
 - biology \to The scientific study of all life and their interactions with the environment.
 - science \to The knowledge obtained from observing natural events and conditions in order to discover facts, and formulate laws and/or principles that can be verified or tested.

** Diversity of Life on Earth

Life can easily be found on Earth almost anywhere you look, for example:
 - Acidic hot pools
 - The deepest and darkest of the ocean floor
 - thousand-year-old ice

They are also different from other lifeforms on Earth, like different:
 - Shapes
 - Sizes

** The Biosphere
The *biosphere* is made up of all living things and the places they are found.
  All parts of the biosphere is connected with all other parts of the biosphere.

The biosphere includes land environments like:
 - deserts
 - grasslands
 - different types of forests
 - saltwater / freshwater environments
 - portion of the atmosphere
   
*Different lifeforms live in different areas.*

** Biodiversity

*Biodiversity* is the variations of organisms in a given area.

*Species* are groups of organisms that are closely related and can produce fertile offspring.

Warmer areas leads to higher survival rates in that area, so more living things, and species can thrive there, leading to more species present in those areas.

As the number of species in an area increases, the biodiversity also increases.

The number of species is the variation of the lifeforms in an area, so biodiversity \prop number of species.

Without these species to reproduce, species will die off, and there will be less variations in lifeforms.

** Biology, the scientific study of all life

Organisms on Earth coexist with other lifeforms and interact with them (other lifeforms) and their environment.

*Biology* is the scientific study of all life and their interactions with the environment.

The study of life has given us a new perspective on life -- we thought only humans could have intelligence and use tools, until we studied chimpanzees.

*Science* is the knowledge obtained from observing natural events and conditions in order to discover facts, and formulate laws and/or principles that can be verified or tested.

** History of Biology

The study and utilization of living things has been going on longer than almost all other science.

** Science in Ancient Civilizations

Many ancient civilizations studied biology, like:
 - herbal medicine in Asian countries
 - agricultural techniques in South American countries
 - mummification and embalming in Ancient Egypt
 - creating the basic principles of science, in Ancient Greece


** The Scientific Revolution

Scientists were limited by society, after the Middle Age, a renewal of sciences was born, called the Scientific Revolution.

Scientific understanding is limited by the available technology -- the Scientific Revolution was spurred on by new technology advances.

** Science from the Industrial Revolution to Today

The Industrial Revolution spurred on several advances to science -- better technology in communication and travel allowed for ideas to spread.

Scientists could explore the world with greater accuracy and precision, which led to new knowledge replacing the old knowledge.
