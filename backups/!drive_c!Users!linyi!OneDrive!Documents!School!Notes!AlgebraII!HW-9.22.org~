* Question 1
** Question 1a
\frac{$h(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 3x - 6$}{x + 2}

Quotient: x^2 - 3
Remainder: 0
** Question 1b
h(-2) = 0

* Question 2
(1)^105 + 1 + 1 = 3
Remainder = 3

* Question 3
(-1)^105 + (-1) + 1 = -1
Remainder = -1

* Question 7
** Question 7a
\frac{$f(x) = x^3 + x^3 + x$}{x + 2}

Quotient: $x^3 - x + 3$
Remainder: -6

** Question 7b
Ans: -6

* Question 11
\frac{x^3 - 12x^2 + 21x + 98}{x + 2}
 = x^2 - 14x + 49

x^2 - 14x + 49 = (x - 7)(x - 7)

B is the answer.

* Question 1
It can only have two roots, because when you look at the graph, a quadratic graph can only intersect the x-axis at most two times.

* Question 3
a = -5

* Question 9
a = -8

* Question 18
** Question 18a
(x^2 + 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)
** Question 18b
(x^2 + 1)(x - 3)(x - 4)
** Question 18c
(x^2 + 1)(x - 2)(x - 1)(x - 4)
** Question 18d
(x^2 + 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 1)
** Question 18e
(x^2 = 1)(x - 4)
** Question 18f
(x^2 + 1)

* Question 3
Remainder = 3

* Question 6
The zeros of a polynomial is what makes at least one of the factors sum to zero.
