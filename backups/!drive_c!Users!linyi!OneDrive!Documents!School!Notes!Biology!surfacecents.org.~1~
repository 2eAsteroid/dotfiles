4. 30 - 40% of CO_2 is being absorbed in the ocean
5. 
6. It causes an increase in acidity in the oceans
7. It increases hydrogen ions in the ocean and
8. It means that for every increment, it increases by a factor of 10
9. pH means the amount of hydrogen ions to hydroxide
10. 
11. It was CO_{2} + H_{2}O =
12. THe rate of acidification has increased since the Industrial Revolution
13. It increases metabolic rates in organisms
14. It alters food chains of humans and animals. The acidification can break down the shells.
