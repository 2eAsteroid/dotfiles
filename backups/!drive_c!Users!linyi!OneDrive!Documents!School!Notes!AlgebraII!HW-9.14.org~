* Polynomial Basics

 - *Polynomial* :: A sum of monomials
 - *Monomial* :: An expression that you can write as a product of a nonzero number, and one or more variables, each raised to a non-negative integer exponent.
 - *Coefficient* :: The nonzero number that is the product of one or more variables in a monomial.
 - *Term* :: The monomials in the polynomial.
 - *Degree* :: The degree of all its terms -- the degree of a monomial is sum of all the exponents of each variable in the monomial.
 - *Normal Form* :: What you get when you apply the basic rules of algebra, collect like terms, and sort the monomials by degree, highest to lowest.

* Rules

 - Two polynomials are equivalent if you can transform them into one another by applying the basic rules of algebra.
 - An identity is a statement that two polynomials are equivalent.
 - If two polynomials are equivalent, then they define equal functions, and will return the same output given the same input.

* Theorems
\newtheorem{zeroproductproperty}{The Zero Product Property}

\begin{zeroproductproperty}
If both a and b are real numbers with a product of 0, then either a or b (or both) must be 0.
