THE INDIAN REBELLION--or Mutiny--of 1857 was one of the most significant events in the history of the British Empire. Indian soldiers in the army of the East India Company in Bengal rose up against their officers, captured and killed many civilians, and nearly overthrew British rule in northern India. Although there is an abundance of first-hand narratives of the year-long Rebellion from Britons and other Europeans, Indian historical voices are largely silent. Apart from official proclamations from the Rebellion's leaders, few original Indian accounts survive, and many historians have pointed out that this is an obvious example of history being written by the victors.
The handful of surviving Indian narratives tell us a great deal about the rebellion, however. They shed light on the condition of the rebels' armies and encampments, the nature of their fighting tactics, the extent and importance of oral communication and rumour in this whole episode, and the great personal difficulties of remaining loyal to the British. The sources are highly individual and relate almost exclusively to the personal experiences of the narrators, usually confined to what they see and their immediate concerns. There is very little comment about the wider rebellion and about its diverse meanings, except that they sketch out some native conceptions and understandings of British rule in India, and the extent to which the British government (and even Parliament itself) was directly involved in creating the conditions which led to the mutiny and then to the wider rebellion.
  



There were many causes of the Indian Rebellion. The traditional explanation of the offensive rifle cartridges causing the initial outbreak of mutiny is only part of the story. Many native infantrymen (sepoys) believed that these new cartridges introduced in early 1857 had been greased by cow and pig fat. The sepoys were required to bite open the cartridges, and would come into direct contact with the cow and pig grease, which was insulting to Hindus and Muslims respectively. But the cartridges were only the catalyst for a revolt that was based on long-standing grievances.
Sepoys in the East India Company army had seen their pay (and therefore their status) decline in recent years, and many felt that the new officers serving in the Company army since the 1840s did not have the same respect and sympathy for sepoys that had been a hallmark of the previous generation of Company officers. Lord Dalhousie, Governor General of India (1847-56) introduced the so-called Doctrine of Lapse, a formula which allowed the East India Company to extend its control into Indian territory when a native ruler died without what the Company considered a legitimate heir. Indian tradition held that adopted children had the same inheritance rights as birth children. But the Company did not recognize adopted heirs. In Oudh, the application of the Doctrine was considered a final outrage of British conquest. Oudh was such a rich and historic part of India that this seizure was seen as a cultural insult. The outbreak of hostilities in the army would not have spread so quickly or gained much-needed local support had not the sepoys' grievances been echoed by discontent in many parts of Bengal, both rural and urban.
  



Sita Ram was a sepoy in the Bengal army and remained loyal to the British throughout 1857 1858. On the urging of his commanding officer, Ram set down his experiences of the rebellion in 1873, and it is from him that we get perhaps the strongest opinion about the causes of the mutiny. He argued that the annexation of Oudh in 1856 under the Doctrine of Lapse, rather than the introduction of greased rifle cartridges, was the major insult that started the widespread discontent among the sepoys and other native soldiers. According to Ram, 'this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government,' because it was received as a unjust exercise of British hegemony over a traditional northern Indian kingdom, and because it would affect the local social and economic standing of the many sepoys who came from that region. By the time the rumour of the greased cartridge became widespread, 'the sepoys' minds had been inflamed by the seizure of Oudh.' FIRST STOP 


Vishnubhat Godse, a young Brahman priest from a village north of Bombay, travelled extensively in northern India during 1857 and 1857, witnessed important events and talked with many people, including native soldiers. He describes meeting two soldiers near Mau (in modern-day Uttar Pradesh) in late February or early March 1857. In his tale (written in 1884) we can see that the rumours of a rebellion started early, and that the cartridge controversy was quickly added to the Oudh annexation insult:
   We halted for the night at a bungalow
  three marches from the cantonment
  of Mau. We stopped to eat ... There
  were no wayfarers at that bungalow,
  but two soldiers had halted there.
  They were going back home via
  Mumbai. A few of us went and sat by
  them to chew betel. We talked of all
  sorts of things and countries. The
  soldiers became exceedingly friendly
  to us ... Finally they told us that three
  days from now there will be a
  revolution. There doubtless will be
  killing and looting too. It seems to us
  (they said) you should all return
  home. Hearing this, we said ... 'kindly
  tell us the exact news that you have
  received.'

     The soldiers began to explain ...
  The older of the two began to speak.
  He said, 'Up to the present time the
  English government has governed
  well. But their intellects have recently
  become corrupted.' Because ... four
  or five months ago they sent us some
  wonderful muskets or carbines from
  England. They take bullets about the
  size of jambhla fruit. The soldiers
  were pleased when these new guns
  and bullets arrived because
  their balls carried about
  two hundred paces
  further than those
  of the old
  muskets. For this
  reason, the new
  guns and their
  ammunition were
  imported and
  distributed to all the
  cantonments in
  Hindusthan. The new
  cartridges had to be
  bitten open for use.
  Four kosa from
  Calcutta in Hindusthan there is a big
  cantonment named Damdam [often
  referred to as Dum Dum] and an
  ammunition factory has been
  established there. It so happened that
  one day a Brahman was taking water
  from a pond, when a Cambhar [a
  street sweeper] came up to him and
  asked him to lend his water-jug so he
  could drink. The Brahman soldier
  told him that if he did so the water
  would be polluted and so he would
  not. Thereupon the Cambhar told
  him not to talk so big about caste
  superiority. The new cartridges are
  greased with cow and pig fat; and I
  grease them with my own hands. And
  when you tear these open with your
  teeth, what remains of your vaunted
  purity? Who needs that hollow sham?
  They came to blows. Many people
  gathered and heard all that had
  transpired. They included many
  soldiers. Soon everyone heard that
  the new cartridges were destructive of
  their religion.



Sita Ram also witnessed how quickly the cartridge story spread.




  

   It chanced that about this time the
  Sirkar sent parties of men from each
  regiment to different garrisons for
  instruction in the use of the new rifle.
  These men performed the new drill
  for some time until a report got
  about, by some means or other, that
  the cartridges used for these new
  rifles were greased with the fat of
  cows and pigs. The men from our
  regiment wrote to others in the
  regiment telling them of this, and
  there was soon excitement in every
  regiment. Some men pointed out that
  in forty years' service nothing had
  ever been done by the Sirkar to insult
  their religion, but as I have already
  mentioned the sepoys' minds had
  been inflamed by the seizure of
  Oudh. Interested parties
  were quick to point out
  that the great aim of
  the English was to
  turn us all into
  Christians and they
  had therefore
  introduced the
  cartridge in order to
  bring this about, since
  both Mahommedans and
  Hindus would be defiled
  by using it.



The soldiers in Godse's story were convinced that the implementation of greased cartridges had received the sanction of Parliament itself in London.




  

   The principal officers in every
  cantonment wrote to Calcutta. The
  Governor Saheb of Calcutta ... wrote
  to England. The matter was
  considered in Parliament assembled.
  They learned that neither the Hindus
  not the Muslims of Hindusthan
  would accept the cartridges ... This
  discussion was going on when a
  distinguished saheb said, 'I have
  much experience of military matters.
  If the assembly so commissions me, I
  will assuredly make them accept the
  cartridges.' The assembly so decreed
  and he immediately set off to
  Hindusthan with loads of cartridges.



In fact, there had been no parliamentary debate on this issue before the mutiny broke out in May 1857. But the belief that the British were attempting a forced conversion (or at least loss of religion) among the army, and that this was premeditated all the way from parliament in London, was clearly very strong.


In early 1857, twenty-one-year-old Pandurang Mahipat Belsare found himself in a frustrating position. His family had lived well before 1854, when the British government took over the estate where they had worked for generations. By 1857, the various business ventures he and his brothers had tried had all failed, and he was anxious to look for work (and adventure) outside his native Pathardi. He could not gain his father's permission to leave, however, so he left secretly with a cousin from a nearby village. His memoir, written in 1900, gives closely-observed accounts of life in the rebel army:
   We moved daily, quietly asking of
  passers-by if they knew where the
  rebels were. When we halted at
  Pachora Vyara, we learned that the
  rebels had plundered Jhalarapatan
  and must be close by. Hearing this, we
  resumed our march. At about nine or
  ten in the morning, we were engulfed
  by a crowd of thousands of infantry
  and cavalry with guns ... We moved
  along with this army and stopped
  where they halted for the night.



Almost immediately, Pandurang and his cousin were taken before the great rebel leader, Tatya Tope, the commander under Nana Sahib, often considered the military genius who kept the rebellion going.




  

   When he examined us as in what we
  were doing, we replied that we had
  heard his fame in the South and so
  had come north from the wish to see
  him. We added that our efforts would
  be fulfilled if some employment was
  also found for us; but he would not
  believe us. He had us searched but no
  papers or any sort were found in our
  possession. But he remained
  suspicious. So he put us in the
  custody of an infantry unit, telling
  them that we were spies. He added,
  'watch them closely'. Accordingly,
  they confined us closely for two or
  three days and interrogated us
  minutely. Had we uttered any
  falsehood, it would have been
  discovered but nothing was found
  against us. They were finally
  convinced that we were not spies. So
  after three or four days, the officer
  produced us before Tatya Tope and
  said, 'Your Honour, we have
  investigated closely but these men are
  not spies; the poor fellows have come
  in search of employment'. Hearing
  this, Tatya Tope summoned the
  artillery commander and instructed
  him to employ the two of us.



The young men saw major action at a battle near Khajuri, in modern Pakistan. Pandurang's account shows the confusion of battle and the struggles that the rebels had in organizing and using their army effectively.
   [One day] the army camped near
  Khajuri village ... The camp was in the
  midst of ravines full of large boulders
  and dense with thorny karavanda
  trees. It was hard for even a single
  man to cross through. It was in this
  difficult place that we were preparing
  to march when a cannon-ball landed
  from the direction of the village and
  the bayonets of the English began to
  be seen in every direction. Then the
  ganima army realized that there was
  no way to escape. So it was decided to
  fight resolutely. So after an exchange
  of artillery fire, the ganima army
  charged the English, silencing their
  batteries and fighting hand to hand.
  The rebels had lost all hope of life
  and fought desperately. So many
  white soldiers were killed and eighty
  horses captured as well as the
  magazine of an artillery unit. The
  English abandoned the position and
  fled. The rebel army also lost many
  killed. An officer called the soldiers
  back to the rear which suddenly
  caused a panicked flight. Those who
  had captured the forward English
  position began to collect the
  abandoned cannon and supplies
  when the English, having seen
  through binoculars that the horses
  had been taken back and the rebels
  were considering how to secure the
  guns, sent forward an infantry
  company with two horse-artillery
  guns. The rebels abandoned the
  supplies and retreated hastily. English
  forces appeared on all sides. Bullets
  and cannonballs rained down.
  Therefore each fled whenever he saw
  a chance of escape ... the flight and
  pursuit went on until sunset. I cannot
  guess how much ground we
  covered ... We were greatly afflicted:
  we had not eaten all day.



Although rebel armies often inflicted heavy defeats on the forces of the East India Company, this theme of disorganization and flight appears often in Pandurang's story.
   Every few days we might encounter
  the English army; then there would
  be fighting for two or three hours,
  but then we would break and scatter
  in every direction ... When the rebels
  fought against the native states such
  as Parana, Barva, Sagar, they would be
  victorious and loot cannon,
  ammunition, cash from the treasury,
  etc. But when they met the English
  armies, they had to flee, abandoning
  those captured artillery pieces.

     If we met the English forces we
  would fight for some time and then
  flee.





  





Sita Ram, who had been captured by rebels and was witness to several of their battles, echoed Pandurang's tale, although from a different ideological standpoint.




  

   ...in no fight that I was in, and there
  were not a few, did I ever see the
  mutineers, be they Hindus or be they
  Mahommedans, ever make a good
  stand and fight. Usually they stood
  the first discharge and then took
  flight, if they could not find shelter
  behind walls or trees. I am told it was
  tough work at [the siege of] Delhi. I
  was not there, but the sepoys could
  not have fought well to have allowed
  an English force of under 10,000 to
  defeat 70,000 with the latter in
  possession of all the houses and
  fortifications.



Not only was the actual fighting difficult, but the conditions that the rebels had to endure during their long campaigns hurt morale and probably contributed to the eventual victory of the Company's forces. After only a brief time in Tope's army, Pandurang complained to a fellow rebel,
   Having experienced life here, I regret
  it every hour. But what is the use of
  that now? Where can I go if I leave
  this army? The English forces are
  present a short distance from us on
  all sides ... Besides that, there are
  insupportable sufferings. Food is not
  to be seen for a week at a time ... As
  for clothes, it being the rainy season,
  and there being no shelter to sleep,
  they were always damp. One sleeps on
  the muddy ground by bringing
  armfuls of palas leaves and spreading
  them for a bed.



Life inside native fortifications was not necessarily better. Vishnubhat Godse was in the rebel fort of Jhansi when it was attacked by the British in April 1858. Although this story refers only to the Jhansi attack, it gives us some sense of the fear that many Indians had of the British army, which they assumed would be vengeful.
   The English began entering the city
  and shooting down every man that
  they saw and setting fire to houses.
  They first commenced burning and
  killing in the Halvaipura quarter.
  They sought out males from the age
  of five to the age of eighty and killed
  them ... Thousands of white soldiers
  entered the city from all side and
  commenced massacring people. The
  terror in the city at this time was
  immeasurable. The screaming and
  crying was endless, At that time there
  was a small garden in the middle of
  the city. People fled into it from all
  directions. Up to 20,000 people were
  gathered there. The English soldiers
  came, whereupon all the people lay
  prone on the ground and begged for
  mercy, saying that they were ordinary
  folk and none of them was a soldier.
  The English had pity on them, posted
  a guard at the gates and went
  elsewhere. They began entering
  homes and killing men they
  encountered; sometimes they caught
  and tortured them, demanding
  rupees, gold, pearls or other
  valuables. If they found these, then
  they sometimes let them go.
  Sometimes they dragged them about
  with their own waistcloths tied about
  their necks in force them to show
  where valuables had been buried; if
  they were found the men might be
  released, only to be killed by the next
  party' of English that came by. But
  they did not kill women. However
  young women of good families feared
  that they would be defiled, and so, as
  soon as the English entered their
  houses they went to the well at the
  back and drowned themselves.
  Sometimes when they were "killing
  men, their womenfolk sought to
  protect them and were killed by
  gunshot. The men would still be
  taken and killed. But women were not
  deliberately killed. If soldiers came to
  a house where there were only
  women they stood at a distance and
  made them surrender their
  ornaments, searched the house and
  left. Horses, camels, cows, dogs and
  cats wandered the streets howling
  from thirst.

     At dusk I climbed up to the roof to
  survey the city. Such was the
  destruction that I trembled in every
  limb at the sight. I was filled with
  dread. The whole city had become a
  land of corpses ... Beyond the
  Halvaipura, the city was ablaze. Huge
  tongues of flame blown by the wind
  leapt from house to house. Such a
  dreadful fate overtook Jhansi as no
  other town has suffered.





  





Of the personal narratives that survive, only Sita Ram's gives us an account of a sepoy loyal to the British. Once he heard of trouble brewing in early 1857, he went to his commander to report the discontent in the ranks.
   I warned him that great madness had
  possessed the minds of the men. I
  could not say what shape the
  discontent would take, but I never
  thought the entire army would
  mutiny--only those men who might
  have suffered as a result of the
  annexation of Oudh--and at present
  only a few of the really bad characters
  were affected. The Colonel sahib was
  of the opinion that the excitement,
  which even he could not fail to see,
  would pass off, as it had often done
  before, and he recommended me to
  go to my home.



After this episode, Sita Ram felt he was being watched, and his fellow sepoys thought he was betraying their feelings to British officials. During the actual uprising, Ram was captured by rebels, who extensively tested his resolve to remain loyal. They preached at him, threatened him, and kept him bound in chains, all of which was intended, he thought, to force British military intelligence from him, or to convert him to the rebel cause. The most effective strategy, and one which almost succeeded, was to show him the famous proclamation of May 11th from the King of Delhi.
   It called on all sepoys to rise and
  destroy the English, promising great
  rewards and promotion if the men of
  any regiment would rise and destroy
  their officers. It stated that the
  English Sirkar intended to make all
  Brahmins into Christians, which had
  in fact been proved correct, and in
  proof of it one hundred Padres were
  about to be stationed in Oudh. Caste
  was going to be broken by forcing
  everyone to eat beef and pork......
  Every man who heard it believed
  every word of it. Even I was impressed
  by it. I had never known the Sirkar to
  interfere with our religion or our
  caste in all the years since I had been
  a soldier, but I was nevertheless filled
  with doubt. I remembered how
  treatment of many regiments with
  regard to field allowance--how it had
  been first promised and then withheld.
  I could not forget that the
  Sirkar had seized Oudh without due
  cause. I had also remarked the
  increase of Padre sahibs during
  recent years, who stood up in the
  streets of our cities and told the
  people that their cherished religion
  was all false, and who exhorted them
  to become Christians. They also maintained
  that they were not employed
  by the Sirkar, but how could they have
  acted like this without the Government's
  sanction? Everyone believed
  that they were secretly employed by
  the Government; why else should they
  take such trouble? Then I
  remembered how the Sirkar had been
  my protector, and that I had eaten its
  salt for over forty years, and I was
  determined never to betray it so long
  as it continued to rule but to do all
  that I could to support it.



He remained loyal during his captivity, and his eventual rescue by British irregular cavalry may have heightened his desire to punish the rebellious sepoys. He mentions that he felt a particular loyalty when fighting alongside these irregulars.


That loyalty would be severely tested at the end of the revolt, however. In one of the most distressing stories from these accounts, Sita Ram found himself in charge of executing rebellious sepoys in early 1858. As he prepared to carry out the execution orders, he recognized one of the prisoners as his own son, whom he had not seen in several years. Ram protested to his superiors that he could not be asked to kill his own son, and after much wrangling and questioning of the son, he was relieved of the execution duty. The son was shot, just like the rest of the prisoners, and Ram ends the 'mutiny' portion of his memoir:




  

   Through the kindness of the Major I
  was allowed to perform the funeral
  rites over my misguided son. He was
  the only one of the prisoners over
  whom they were performed,
  for the remainder were all thrown to
  the jackals and the vultures.



This personal tragedy brings home not only the difficulties that loyal sepoys had to face as the rebellion ended, but in a sense also symbolizes the way in which native evidence from 1857 has survived. Had the rebels been comprehensively victorious, that is, had British rule in India been overthrown, much more Indian evidence would probably have been created and preserved. After all, defeated sepoys were naturally afraid of retribution from the British, and were undoubtedly reluctant to tell their 'mutiny stories'. Some, such as the ones presented here, survive. But the rest have been lost to history, scattered, so to speak, among the jackals and vultures of abandoned memory.
