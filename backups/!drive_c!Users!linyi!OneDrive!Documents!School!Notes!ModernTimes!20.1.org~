* Setting the Stage
 - French ideas about equality and democracy got to European colonies, who hated European colonization powers, so they want to win independence.
 
* Colonial Society Divided
 - Society was dictated by classes, going from highest to lowest:
   - peninsulares :: Spaniards born in Spain, they hold the highest positions, and only they can hold those positions
   - Creoles :: Spaniards born in Latin America, they can't get to high political positions, but they can rise in armies
   - Mestizos :: People of mixed European and Native American ancestry
   - Mulattos :: People of mixed European and African ancestry \iff Enslaved Africans
   - People of Native American descent
