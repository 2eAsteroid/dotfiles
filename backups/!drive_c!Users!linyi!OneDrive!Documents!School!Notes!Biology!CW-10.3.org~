* Summary
Humans learn by making categories and have been doing this with living things for a long time:
 - Safe/Dangerous
 - Tasty/Poisonous
 - Animals/Plants

This is useful, but arbitrary. Who makes the categories and rules? Are the the most important rules?
 - Red organisms
 - four-legged organisms that eat meat, make milk, and have retractable claws.
