* Part 1: Volume vs. Amount
** Directions
1. Get a balloon and a meter stick (or 30cm ruler).
2. Select a student who will blow up the balloon (me).
3. Completely fill your lungs with air by inhaling. Exhale into the balloon.
4. Measure the diameter along the 2 axes of the sphere. Calculate the average diameter.
5. Repeat until the balloon has been completely filled.
6. Calculate the average radius and the average volume of the balloon for each run.
7. Plot a graph of average volume vs. amount (breaths). Use a best fit line and identify the relationship between volume and amount.
** Data: Volume and Amount
| Amount (breaths) | Length (cm) | Width (cm) | Average Radius (L + W)/4 | Volume (4/3 \pi cm^{3}) |
